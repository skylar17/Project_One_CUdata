# Air Pollution in India Pre/Post COVID-19
Columbia University Data Analytics Boot Camp - Project 1.

# Project Description
Air pollution refers to the release of pollutants into the air that are detrimental to human health and the planet as a whole. Most of these air pollutants come from burning fossil fuels that release gases and chemicals into the air  (The Natural Resources Defense Council). With the current lockdowns of COVID-19,  India’s consumption of these fossil fuels have drastically decreased. In this project, we will analyze and create visualizations that compare the air pollution in India’s four major cities pre and post COVID-19 times.

# Research Questions to Answer
How has COVID-19 affected air pollution in four major cities in different regions of India?
